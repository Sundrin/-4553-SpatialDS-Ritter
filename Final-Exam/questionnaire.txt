1. Python was a great language for this course. Interesting new concepts were taught.

2. I think more focus on the data structures would have been the way to go. Maybe learn more about where the data structures are used most.

3. In my opinion, 5 programs is enough for the semester, however it would be cool to have some homeworks with code snippets of the data structures to insert nodes or something of that nature.

4. Statement

5. I did not turn in all my programs. I can give you a list of excuses, but in all honesty there were times I just couldn't understand how, or what, to code.

6. I'd love to see a B. I really tried the programs and thought I dominated that first exam, but if you think a C is more appropriate then I'm okay with that as well.
